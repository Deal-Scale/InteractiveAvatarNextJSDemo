 Live Music API - WebSockets API reference

Preview: The Live Music API is in preview.

Lyria RealTime music generation uses a persistent, bidirectional, low-latency streaming connection using WebSockets. In this section, you'll find additional details regarding the WebSockets API.
Sessions

A WebSocket connection establishes a session to keep a real-time communication with the model. After a client initiates a new connection the session can exchange messages with the server to:

    Send prompts and controls to steer music generation.
    Send music playback controls.
    Receive audio chunks.

WebSocket connection

To start a session, connect to this websocket endpoint:

wss://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/ws/google.ai.generativelanguage.v1alpha.GenerativeService.BidiGenerateMusic

Note: The URL is for version v1alpha.
Session configuration

The initial message after connection sets the model to use during the session.

See the following example configuration. Note that the name casing in SDKs may vary. You can look up the Python SDK configuration options here.


{
  "model": string
}

Send messages

To exchange messages over the WebSocket connection, the client must send a JSON object over an open WebSocket connection. The JSON object must have exactly one of the fields from the following object set:


{
  "setup": BidiGenerateMusicSetup,
  "client_content": BidiGenerateMusicClientContent,
  "music_generation_config": BidiGenerateMusicGenerationConfig,
  "playback_control": BidiGenerateMusicPlaybackControl
}

Supported client messages

See the supported client messages in the following table:
Message 	Description
BidiGenerateMusicSetup 	Session configuration to be sent only in the first message
BidiGenerateMusicClientContent 	Weighted prompts as the model input
BidiGenerateMusicGenerationConfig 	Configuration for music generation
BidiGenerateMusicPlaybackControl 	Playback control signals for model generation
Receive messages

To receive messages from the server, listen for the WebSocket 'message' event, and then parse the result according to the definition of the supported server messages.

See the following:

async def receive_audio(session):
  """Example background task to process incoming audio."""
  while True:
    async for message in session.receive():
      audio_data = message.server_content.audio_chunks[0].data
      # Process audio...
      await asyncio.sleep(10**-12)

async with (
  client.aio.live.music.connect(model='models/lyria-realtime-exp') as session,
  asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg,
):
  # Set up task to receive server messages.
  tg.create_task(receive_audio(session))

  # Send initial prompts and config
  await session.set_weighted_prompts(
    prompts=[
      types.WeightedPrompt(text='minimal techno', weight=1.0),
    ]
  )
  await session.set_music_generation_config(
    config=types.LiveMusicGenerationConfig(bpm=90, temperature=1.0)
  )

  # Start streaming music
  await session.play()
