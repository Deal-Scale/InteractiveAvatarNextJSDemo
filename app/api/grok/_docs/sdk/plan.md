# Grok SDK Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the tasks required to build a complete Grok SDK that wraps every endpoint documented in [`core.md`](./core.md) and the upstream [AI SDK Core reference](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core). Each task is scoped for tracking in the project board and is tagged with its dependencies.

## Guiding Principles
- **Parity with API:** Every exported function must align with the upstream contract, including optional parameters and streaming behaviors.
- **Typed Interfaces:** Use TypeScript types (with Zod schemas where applicable) to guarantee compile-time and runtime validation.
- **Composable Architecture:** Separate transport, authentication, and domain logic so we can swap HTTP clients or plug in caching later.
- **DX Tooling:** Provide examples, inline docs, and tests for each module.

## Milestones & Tasks

| V2 | Message models | Define `ModelMessage`, `UIMessage`, `validateUIMessages`, `safeValidateUIMessages`. | TBD | V1 |
| V3 | ID utilities | Implement `generateId` and `createIdGenerator` with collision tests. | TBD | F3 |

### Milestone 8 — Documentation & Samples
| ID | Task | Description | Owner | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | API reference | Auto-generate reference docs from TypeScript comments using `typedoc`. | TBD | All feature modules |
| D2 | Usage guides | Provide cookbook examples for text, embeddings, media, and tool integrations. | TBD | D1 |
| D3 | Change log | Establish versioned CHANGELOG with semantic release workflow. | TBD | F2 |

## Tracking & Reporting
- Track tasks in the issue tracker using the IDs above (e.g., `SDK-F1`).
- Each milestone culminates in a demo checklist verifying parity against the upstream documentation.
- Establish a weekly sync to review progress, blockers, and upcoming dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- 100% endpoint coverage with integration tests hitting the Grok sandbox environment.
- Developer documentation published and linked from `/app/api/grok/_docs/sdk/README.md`.
- Automated CI (lint, type-check, tests) green for the new SDK package.
