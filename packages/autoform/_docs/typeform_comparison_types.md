 Question types

You build your form out of questions. Here are all the different question types that you can use to create your form.

You’ll find all the questions in the Content panel. To get here, log in to your account, open an existing form, or start a new one, and the Content panel will open. Click Add content to open the menu.

Note! You won't be able to change the question type of Ending or Question Group blocks.

This is what the question menu looks like. Read on for a short description of each question type, and links to further reading.

You'll be taken directly to the Add content tab where you can choose what type of question you want to add. If you want to Import questions, Create a form with AI, or Qualify leads using AI, just click on the tab you need at the top of the screen.

Rating & ranking

NPS®

NPS® is a research metric commonly used to ask people how likely they are to recommend a company, product or service to someone on a scale from 0 to 10. Respondents are grouped into promoters (a rating of 9 or 10), passives (a rating of 7 or 8), and detractors (a rating of 6 or lower). Learn more about NPS®.

Opinion Scale

This lets people give a rating from one to ten. You can define the range with the steps tool. Read more about Opinion Scale.

Short Text

If you want a short written answer from people, this is what you need. You can choose a character limit for answers, from 0-999 characters.

Video

Let your respondents answer your questions by recording videos of themselves directly in your form. Learn more here.

Question settings

Every question also has a Question reference. These refs are for developers using our APIs—it’s a unique identifier that allows you to easily identify each question in your code. Clicking Block references in the Settings menu allows you to change this reference to whatever you like.

Block references can be changed for individual questions, Welcome Screen, and End Screens. They can't be changed on individual fields within the Contact Info question type.

Note! The Question reference field will accept any alpha character (a-z, A-Z), any digit (0-9), ‘-‘ (dash), and ‘_’ (underscore). It will not accept any special characters such as $#%&, spaces, or empty text. If you see an “Argh” error when setting your refs, make sure you’re not using any special characters
